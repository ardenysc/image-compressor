### Description
Compresses PNG images while preserving the main objectâ€™s features. Works best with square images.
This was a programming assignment for UBC CPSC 221, Basic Algorithms and Data Structures.

### Features
- Image is rendered using quadtrees, where each node holds the RGBA values of a single pixel
- Uses lossy image compression algorithm where pixels with less color variance are pruned
- Users can specify their preferred tolerance level, which determines the degree of pruning applied to pixels.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Run main.cpp (change input images as necessary)
